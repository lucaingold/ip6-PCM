# IP5 - Power Consumption Manager
The Power Consumption Manager is an android mobile application that was realized in form of a school project.

# Installation guide
* Download the .apk file from the release page ([Download](https://github.com/radaced/ip5-PCM/releases))
* Copy the file onto your phone in case you didn't directly download it to your phone.
* Click on the downloaded .apk file to run it.
  * In case the android system doesnt' let you install the .apk you need to allow the installation of apps from unknown sources. Go to Settings > Security and in the category Device Administration make sure to check Unknown sources.
* The application asks you for internet permissions (needed for the web requests to the server component).
* Confirm and after installation run the application.

# Initial use of the app
The app will ask you to configure an IP address. The IP address needs to be the IP address of the server component and both devices (phone and device where server component runs on) need to be in the same network. The IP address can be reconfigured on the main screen of the app when you click on the settings icon.
